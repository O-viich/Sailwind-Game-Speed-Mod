# Sailwind-Game-Speed-Mod
Speeds up the gamespeed in Sailwind for faster sailing

Requires the Sailwind Mod Manager: https://github.com/MaxWasUnavailable/SailwindModRepository

Detailed Installation:
* Install Unity Mod Manager
* Install the Sailwind Component into the game from the Unity Mod Manager
* Drop Sailwind Mod Manager into the Install-Dir of Sailwind
* Run Sailwind Mod Manager and set a mod directory (i.e. "./mods", what will make the mod manager look for a "mods" folder in the install dir)
* Unzip this mod into the mods folder

Usage Instructions:
* After running Sailwind for the first time, the unity mod manager window will pop-up. Go to the settings tab and change the default keybind from "shift+f10", as F10 seems to toggle the Sailwind Menu
* Once a game is loaded and you want the game speed to be adjusted, bring up the menu with the keybind
* Hit the icon next to "version" with the sliders of the Time Warp mod
* Use the slider to set the game speed
* Press "Save" in the bottom left corner of the window to apply changes
